title: window width and height
description: You can use 'inner' and 'outer' variants of width and height properties to get the dimentions of the window element. The 'innerWidth' and 'innerHeight' properties capture window sizes excluding scrollbars or toolbars. On the other hand 'outerWidth' and 'outerHeight' properties capture the full area of the browser window including all the panels and scrollbars.
