description: A simple example of the CSS animation unig 'from' and 'to' keyframes. First, the animation states are being set within the @keyframe attribute. You need to give it a reference name, 'glow' in the example. In the second block the animation is being triggered by calling it's name in the 'animation-name' tag. The animation-duration allows to set the time elapsed between 'from' and 'to' keyframes.
